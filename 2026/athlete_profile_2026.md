- **Zone 6** (<3:49/km): 40m 40s (speed work)

**Key Insight**: 36% in Zone 2 shows good aerobic base maintenance, with appropriate quality work distribution

### Recent Speed Sessions (Dec 2025):

**December 9 - 8x600m repeats:**
- Average pace: 3:44/km
- Range: 3:34-3:58/km
- Recovery: 1:00 between reps

### Current Speed Capabilities (Dec 2025):
Based on recent workouts:
- **Pure speed** (200m): 3:15-3:35/km = 16:15-17:45 5K equivalent
- **VO2max** (600m): 3:34-3:58/km = 17:50-19:50 5K equivalent
- **Threshold** (1200m): 3:55-3:59/km = 19:35-19:55 5K equivalent
- **Sustained threshold** (3km): 3:55/km = 19:35 5K equivalent
- **Current 5K PR**: 4:01/km = 20:04

**Critical Analysis**:
- Training paces suggest sub-20 5K is achievable (Dec 28 attempt)
- Already hitting 3:34/km for 600m reps (faster than sub-18 pace of 3:36/km)
- Gap from training to racing: Need to close ~15-25 seconds/km
- Excellent speed reserve for 2026 goals

### Training Periodization Pattern:
**Smart progression toward Dec 28 race:**
1. Week 1: 8x600m (speed endurance, faster pace)
2. Week 2: 4x1200m (threshold development, race-specific)
3. Week 3: 3km + 200m (race simulation + speed maintenance)
4. Volume taper: 36.3 → 30.2 → 24.1km

This shows **sophisticated race preparation** with proper taper execution.

### Post-Race Recovery Plan (Critical for 2026):
**After December 28, 2025 race:**
- Week of Dec 29-Jan 4: Recovery week (15-20km max, all easy pace)
- Week of Jan 5-11: Light rebuilding (20-25km, easy + strides)
- Week of Jan 12+: Begin structured 2026 season plan

**Rationale**: 
- High-intensity December training requires recovery
- Maximal effort in race will cause fatigue
- 2 weeks easy running prevents injury starting 2026
- Maintains fitness while allowing adaptation

## 💡 KEY INSIGHTS FOR PLAN DESIGN

### What Works Well
1. **Progressive builds**: Gradual volume increase with quality mixed in
2. **Smart backing off**: Knows when to ease off to prevent injury
3. **Heat tolerance**: Can race well in Santo Domingo conditions
4. **Testing protocol**: Regular validation through tests/races
5. **Speed development**: Responds well to interval training

### What Needs Attention
1. **Long run volume**: Need to safely progress to 25-30km for HM prep
2. **Sustained high volume**: Building 50-70km weeks consistently
3. **Terrain selection**: Finding appropriate routes for key sessions
4. **Mental endurance**: Building confidence for extended efforts

### Realistic Progressions Needed
**Current 5K Fitness (Dec 2025)**:
- 19:51 5K capability with moderate effort
- Gap to sub-18: 1:51 (from 19:51 to 18:00)
- Shows 22 sec/km improvement needed (3:58 → 3:36)
- Speed reserve exists (3:31/km optimum pace shown)
- 75-80% chance of sub-18 with 16-week focused training
   
2. **10K (43:30 → 40:00)**: 3:30 improvement = 8.0% faster
   - Requires lactate threshold work + volume
   - July timeline gives 12 weeks after 5K
   
3. **21K (1:45:00 → 1:35:00)**: 10:00 improvement = 9.5% faster
   - Biggest absolute improvement needed
   - October timeline gives 15 weeks after 10K
   - Requires significant aerobic development + long run volume

---

## 🎯 PLAN REQUIREMENTS

### Must Address
1. Safe volume progression from 30-35km → 70-85km peak
2. Three distinct training phases (5K → 10K → 21K focus)
3. Two "training races" that don't compromise main goals
4. Heat/humidity management strategies
5. Long run progression to 25-30km
6. Recovery between PB attempts
7. Taper strategies for each goal race

### Success Factors
1. Consistency (leverage 96-week streak)
2. Smart recovery (proven ability to manage fatigue)
3. Quality execution (proven in workouts/races)
4. Environmental adaptation (Santo Domingo conditions)
5. Data-driven adjustments (testing + validation)
